I have often written about the intersection of pop culture and some of my academic interests. For example, have you ever wondered about how gossip works in the _Bigg Boss_ house? I covered our working paper about it <u>[here](https://www.firstpost.com/living/bigg-boss-gossip-and-survival-the-reality-show-illustrates-how-talking-about-others-is-a-powerful-social-tool-7477631.html)</u> in <i>FirstPost</i>. 

I know I shouldn't pick favourites, but here is a fun snippet of some of the pieces I had a blast working towards: 

<dl>
<dt><b>How do memes work?</b></dt>

<dd>
<a href="https://www.firstpost.com/living/how-memes-gained-cultural-currency-driving-socio-political-discourse-in-the-digital-era-7804161.html"> <u>Here</u> </a> are my thoughts about them. </dd>
    
    
<dt><b>What does <i>Parks and Recreation</i> teach us about the philosophy of friendship?</b></dt>

<dd>You can read about it <a href="https://www.thinkpragati.com/housefull-home/housefull-ph/7065/parks-recreation-friendship/"><u>here</u></a>.</dd>
  
  
<dt><b>What do you think about extravagant celebrity weddings?</b></dt>

<dd>My (and my colleague's) thoughts in this <i>BuzzFeed</i> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=441722426592139"><u>video</u></a>. 
</dd>
  
<dt><b>Like everyone else, I used to really like  Ariana Grande's <i>Thank U Next</i> when it came out</b></dt>

<dd>So wrote about what the song teaches us about self-love <a href="https://www.thinkpragati.com/housefull-home/housefull-ph/6514/her-name-is-ari/"> <u>here</u> </a>
    </dd>
  
<dt><b>Anyone who knows me in real life knows how much I talk about death and <i>Hamilton</i></b></dt>

<dd>So wrote a piece about death and Hamilton <a href = "https://www.thinkpragati.com/housefull-home/housefull-ph/6222/like-a-beat-without-a-melody/"> <u>here</u> </a>. 
Can I just say "like a beat without a melody" is such a beautiful way to describe it? </dd>
  
<dt><b>Impostor Phenomenon doesn't really go away, right?</b></dt>
 
<dd> Turned my Master's project into a <a href = "https://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/5k7ZxYoHPBz5XtPRbaKWbM/Impostor-Phenomenon-where-selfdoubt-rules-and-success-does.html"> <u>piece</u></a> for <i>Mint on Sunday</i>.</dd>
  
  
<dt><b>Like I said, I love reading and binge-watching shows</b></dt>

<dd> So, wrote a piece about <i>why</i> we might be drawn to imaginary worlds for <i>The Swaddle</i>. Read that <a href = "https://theswaddle.com/why-were-drawn-to-imaginary-worlds/"> <u>here</u> </a></dd>
