Over the years, I have also attempted to communicate our research and ideas via popular magazines and newspaper articles.

I have often written about the intersection of pop culture and some of my academic interests. For example, have you ever wondered about how gossip works in the _Bigg Boss_ house? I covered our working paper about it [here](https://www.firstpost.com/living/bigg-boss-gossip-and-survival-the-reality-show-illustrates-how-talking-about-others-is-a-powerful-social-tool-7477631.html) in <i>FirstPost</i>. 

I know I shouldn't pick favourites, but here is a fun snippet of some of the pieces I had a blast working towards: 

<p><b><center>How do memes work?</center></b>

[Here](https://www.firstpost.com/living/how-memes-gained-cultural-currency-driving-socio-political-discourse-in-the-digital-era-7804161.html) are my thoughts about them. </p>
    
    
<p><b><center>What does <i>Parks and Recreation</i> teach us about the philosophy of friendship?</center></b>
You can read about it <a href="https://www.thinkpragati.com/housefull-home/housefull-ph/7065/parks-recreation-friendship/">here</a>. </p>
  
  
<p><b><center>What do you think about extravagant celebrity weddings?</center></b>
My (and my colleague's) thoughts in this <i>BuzzFeed</i> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=441722426592139">video</a>. 
</p>
  
<p><b><center>I was obsessed with Ariana Grande's <i>Thank U Next</i></center></b>

So wrote about what the song teaches us about self-love [here.](https://www.thinkpragati.com/housefull-home/housefull-ph/6514/her-name-is-ari/)
    </p>
  
<p><b><center>Anyone who knows me in real life knows how much I obsess about death and <i>Hamilton</i></center></b>

So wrote a piece about death and Hamilton [here](https://www.thinkpragati.com/housefull-home/housefull-ph/6222/like-a-beat-without-a-melody/). 
Can I just say "like a beat without a melody" is such a beautiful way to describe it? </p>
  
<p><b><center>Impostor Phenomenon doesn't really go away, right?</center></b>
 
Turned my Master's project into a [piece](https://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/5k7ZxYoHPBz5XtPRbaKWbM/Impostor-Phenomenon-where-selfdoubt-rules-and-success-does.html) for _Mint on Sunday_.</p>
  
  
<p><b><center>Like I said, I love reading and binge-watching stuff</center></b>

So, wrote a piece about _why_ we might be drawn to imaginary worlds for _The Swaddle_. Read that [here.](https://theswaddle.com/why-were-drawn-to-imaginary-worlds/)</p>
