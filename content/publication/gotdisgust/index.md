abstract: The HBO show Game of Thrones is fascinating, because despite many of its plot points involving the elicitation of disgust, an emotion associated with avoidance behaviors, its viewership has only surged. We explore the relationship between disgust sensitivity and perception of scenes involving moral, sexual, and pathogen disgust in the show by providing participants with descriptions of such scenes. Participants included those who had never seen the show, those who had seen the show at least once, and those who had seen the show multiple times. We found that those who had watched the show once rated the scenes as less disgusting (overall and for moral and sexual disgust) than those who had not. We also investigated sex differences in disgust and found that women rated the scenes as more aversive than men, especially those involving moral and sexual disgust. Finally, those with more opposite sex siblings were more repulsed by the scenes, especially those involving sexual disgust. The present study adds to a long list of studies that analyses popular culture from an adaptive lens and adds to the notion that popular culture is a ‘cultural remain’ of the evolved human mind.
